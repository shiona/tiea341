This is a list of errors I've found on the exercise pages.

- The filter laws: 
  Example code of monotonicity should be:
  'length (filter f xs) <= length xs'

- Credits page
  Link to Binary tree project points to
  /TIES343/Chapters/00059_Project_Binary_Tree.html.
  should be 
  /TIES343/Chapters/00059_Project_Binary_Tree.html

- Project: A Binary Tree:
  First link "Binary trees", points to: 
  /TIES343/Chapters/Chapters/00052_Codata.md
  should be:
  /TIES343/Chapters/00052_Codata.html

  'The idea behind binary trees is to ensure that every 
  key stored in the left subtree is smaller than the key 
  at the current branch and that everything else is 
  stored in the right subtree.'
  But the code speaks otherwise:
   | key <=  k = Branch (k,v) (insert key value left) right

- Codata
  Example 'take 5 myList', after second application is given as
  '1:2:take 4 (3:myList)'
  should be
  '1:2:take 3 (3:myList)'
